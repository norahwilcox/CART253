Frog tounge recharge bar ... (How long does the tounge recharge? What does the bar look like? Where is the bar placed? Does the bar make a sound when full? Does the tounge have a coiling animation to match the speed of the recharge bar? Would certain tounge movements have slower and faster recharge?)
More bugs ... (How many more bugs per level? Would the bugs travel in groups or alone? How many bugs does it take to acheive a goal?)
Larger variety of bugs ... (What type of bugs? Would larger species have larger reward? What would the bugs animations look like? Would different bug species get along or avoid each other? Are some bugs smarter than others? Maybe there's a guide on each species and their behavior.)
Bug catch counter ... (Are there multiple counters for the different species of bug? Where are the counters placed? What counts as a bug caught? Do the counters have a goal or limit?)
Frog eating animation ... (Does the animation have sound? How long does the animation last? Do the Frog's eyes move? What emotion does the frog show? Does the frog change colour? Does the frog do a little wiggle?)
On screen timer (Is the timer counting down? Does the timer change to be shorter/longer based on the gameplay? Where is the counter placed? What does the counter look like? Does the timer display seconds, minutes and miliseconds? How long is the timer for? What is the purpose of timing? Is the timer meant to increase stress on the player?)
Bug sound effects ... (What sounds do the bugs make? Do the bugs say words? Do the bugs scream in agony? )
