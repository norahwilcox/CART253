## Description

> "You Look Fly!" is a cute point and click game that allow the player to catch flies as a little frog sitting on a rock.

> The experience is controlled via the mouse, with left click controlling the frog's tongue movement.

> The game is timed on the left side of the screen. When the timer runs out, the player loses. To win, the player must catch enough flies using the frog's tongue to fill up the counter on the right side of the screen.
