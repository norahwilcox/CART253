## Description

> Variation Jam! is a cute pixel art character creator inspired by childhood character customization games on flash.

> The experience is controlled completely via the mouse, using left click to press buttons which customize your character however you please.

> Use the tabs above the folder to navigate which elements you would like to change and click the "done" button once your little guy is finished!
